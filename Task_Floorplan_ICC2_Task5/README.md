# Task 5: SoC Floorplanning Using ICC2 (Floorplan Only)

A floorplan-only implementation of the raven_wrapper Processor using Synopsys ICC2, targeting fixed die dimensions of **3.588 mm × 5.188 mm** on SCL 180 nm technology with reserved IO bands around the core.

---

## 📋 Overview

This project corresponds to **Task 5: SoC Floorplanning Using ICC2**, with a strictly limited scope that stops after floorplan creation and geometry verification. The emphasis is on accurate die/core definition, IO ring reservation using hard placement blockages, and report-driven validation, without any placement, clock tree, routing, or power planning.

**Scope & Constraints:**

- ✓ Floorplan-only, no placement, CTS, routing, or IR/EM analysis
- ✓ No macros or memory hard IPs; raven memories are synthesized logic
- ✓ Synthesized netlist is imported only to provide design context and ports
- ✓ Verification is via reports and GUI visualization, not timing closure

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following environment inputs are available before running the Tcl flow:

- **Synopsys ICC2 2022.12** (or compatible) installation with valid license
- **SCL 180 nm** PDK reference NDM library (standard cells + tech data)
- **Pre-synthesized raven** Verilog netlist
- Linux shell with Tcl support for batch runs and scripting

### Running the Floorplan Flow

**Method 1 – Batch Mode**

```bash
cd scripts/
icc2 -64bit -f floorplan.tcl
```

**Method 2 – Interactive ICC2 Session**

```tcl
icc2 -64bit
source scripts/floorplan.tcl
place_ports -self      ;# Optional: auto-distribute top ports
gui_show_man_page      ;# Optional: view floorplan in GUI
```

### Generated Artifacts

## 📐 Floorplan Specification

### Die and Core Geometry

The floorplan is fully defined using absolute coordinates for repeatability across runs.

```
Die Extents : [0, 0] → [3588, 5188] µm
Core Extents: [200, 200] → [3388, 4988] µm
Core Margin : 200 µm (all four sides)
Total Area  : 18.606 mm²
```

**Initialization Command:**

```tcl
initialize_floorplan \
    -control_type die \
    -boundary {{0 0} {3588 5188}} \
    -core_offset {300 300 300 300}
```

This creates a rectangular die with a core inset by 300 µm on all sides, leaving a continuous peripheral band for IO and power structures.

**Why These Dimensions?**

- The die size (3.588 mm × 5.188 mm) represents the target silicon footprint negotiated with foundry rules and packaging constraints
- Core margin of 200 µm balances standard cell placement area with IO infrastructure needs in 180 nm technology
- Aspect ratio of ~1.44:1 (height:width) optimizes routing channel distribution between horizontal and vertical tracks

### IO Region Reservation with Hard Blockages

IO bands are reserved using **hard placement blockages**, ensuring no standard cells are placed where IO pads, ESD structures, and future power rings may exist.

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Blockage Coordinate Definitions:**

| Region | Boundary (µm) | Size | Purpose |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Bottom | [0, 0] → [3588, 100] | Full width × 100 µm | Power delivery, ground ring, bottom pad row |
| Top | [0, 5088] → [3588, 5188] | Full width × 100 µm | Power delivery, ground ring, top pad row |
| Left | [0, 100] → [100, 5088] | 100 µm × core height | ESD clamps, level shifters, left pad row |
| Right | [3488, 100] → [3588, 5088] | 100 µm × core height | ESD clamps, level shifters, right pad row |

Each blockage is declared as `-type hard`, creating permanent no-placement zones that prevent standard cell placement while allowing future insertion of pad cells, power rings, and specialty circuits.

**Example Blockage Creation:**

```tcl
create_placement_blockage \
  -name IO_BOTTOM -type hard \
  -boundary {{0 0} {3588 100}}

create_placement_blockage \
  -name IO_TOP -type hard \
  -boundary {{0 5088} {3588 5188}}

create_placement_blockage \
  -name IO_LEFT -type hard \
  -boundary {{0 100} {100 5088}}

create_placement_blockage \
  -name IO_RIGHT -type hard \
  -boundary {{3488 100} {3588 5088}}
```

## 📊 floorplanning Using Synonpsys ICC2 

commands to access the Synopsys tools:
```csh
csh
source ~/tooliitgn
```

Go to the directory "~/icc2Workshop/standalone" and use this commands
- make sure the tcl scripts exist in the current directory

```csh
icc2_shell -f floorplan.tcl | tee floorplan.log
```
![Alt Text](images/fp1.png)

To see the visualizations of Floorplanned design:

```csh
iic2_shell> start_gui
```
![Alt Text](images/fp2.png)
The above visuals declares that the IO blocks are not properly placed inside the IO Pads area of the design

The few coordinates changes in the file "pads_contraints.tcl" solves the above problem but the ports are not placed as per the ports order but placed perfectly in the IO Pad area

After making the changes in the respective file the design will look like:
![Alt Text](images/fp3.png)

## 📊 Port Placement & Visualization

### Automatic Port Distribution

After script execution, ports can be auto-placed for visualization:

```tcl
place_ports -self
```
![Alt Text](images/fp4.png)

--
## 📊 DEF Creation
Commands to create .def file in the tcl command terminal in gui/shell

```csh
write _def raven_wrapper.floorplan.def
```

![Alt Text](images/fp5.png)

**What This Command Does:**

- Analyzes top-level port list from imported netlist
- Calculates perimeter distribution accounting for die geometry
- Places port instances automatically along die edges
- Respects IO region blockages to avoid conflicts
- Provides preliminary pinout for early validation

**When to Use:**

- During design review to show expected IO placement
- For congestion analysis to estimate routing demand near pads
- For package feasibility checks with electrical stakeholders
- As baseline before manual port refinement in later flows

### GUI Inspection Commands

Once floorplan is loaded in ICC2, use these commands for visualization:

```tcl
# Display interactive floorplan viewer
gui_show_man_page

# Query all ports and their locations
get_ports

# List blockage definitions and verify coverage
get_placement_blockages

# Zoom to full design extent
zoom_extents

# Show layer details (metal, via definitions)
gui_show_layer_info
```

**Expected Visualization:**

- ✓ Cyan die boundary outline (rectangular, no concavities)
- ✓ Blue core region rectangle (inset 200 µm on all sides)
- ✓ Gray shaded blockage areas (four IO bands around core)
- ✓ Port markers along die edges (red or green circles)
- ✓ Clear spacing between core and IO bands

---

## ✅ Verification Workflow

### Automated Checks in ICC2

Run these commands to validate correctness of floorplan constraints:

```tcl
# Check die size and core boundaries
get_floorplan -all

# Validate core bounds match initialization
get_core_bounds

# List and count all blockages
get_placement_blockages -all

# Verify port count matches netlist
llength [get_ports]

# Check for blockage overlaps or inconsistencies
report_placement_blockage -all
```

**Verification Script Example:**

```tcl
proc verify_floorplan {} {
    set die [get_floorplan -all]
    set core [get_core_bounds]
    set blockages [get_placement_blockages -all]
    set port_count [llength [get_ports]]
    
    puts "Die bounds: $die"
    puts "Core bounds: $core"
    puts "Blockage count: [llength $blockages]"
    puts "Port count: $port_count"
    
    # Add logic to check expected values
    if {[llength $blockages] != 4} {
        puts "ERROR: Expected 4 IO blockages!"
    }
}

verify_floorplan
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Reference library not found"

```
Symptom: ICC2 exits with file-not-found error on REF_LIB
Cause:   REF_LIB path is incorrect, file doesn't exist, or permissions restricted
Fix:     1. Verify absolute path: echo $REF_LIB
         2. Check file exists: file exists /path/to/lib.ndm
         3. Check permissions: ls -l /path/to/lib.ndm
         4. Update REF_LIB variable to correct location
Example: set REF_LIB "/opt/foundry/scl180nm/lib.ndm"
```

Incorrect or missing reference libraries are a common setup issue when migrating ICC2 scripts across environments.

### Error: "Unresolved cell references in netlist"

```
Symptom: Warning messages about cells not found in libraries
Cause:   Netlist instantiates cells absent from reference library
Fix:     This is expected for floorplan-only scope where placement is skipped
         Optionally add -continue_on_error flag to suppress warnings:
         read_verilog -continue_on_error -top $DESIGN_NAME raven.v
```

At the floorplan stage, only geometry and port inventory matter; full library completeness is not required.

### Error: "Blockage boundaries invalid"

```
Symptom: ICC2 reports blockage creation failure
Cause:   Blockage coordinates extend outside die extents or overlap improperly
Fix:     Verify all blockage boundaries are within die [0,3588]×[0,5188]
         Check math for left/right overlap: 100 + 3488 = 3588 ✓
         Validate top/bottom overlap: 0 + 100 = 100, 5088 + 100 = 5188 ✓
Debug:   Print coordinates: puts "Checking: 3488 + 100 = [expr {3488 + 100}]"
```

ICC2 strictly enforces that all geometric primitives lie entirely within the defined floorplan boundary.

### Ports not visible in GUI

```
Symptom: GUI shows core and blockages but no port markers
Cause:   Ports exist but have no physical coordinate assignment
Fix:     Run automatic placement: place_ports -self
         Then refresh view: gui_show_man_page
         Or manually set port location: place_port port_name -location {x y edge}
Verify:  Check port assignment: get_ports -filter "is_placed == true"
```

Port placement is a separate step from port definition and may require explicit commands or GUI interaction.

### Script execution hangs or times out

```
Symptom: ICC2 process appears stuck or does not complete
Cause:   Waiting for interactive input, library locked, or filesystem issue
Fix:     1. Kill hanging process: pkill -9 icc2
         2. Remove stale locks: rm -f raven_fp_lib/.icv_lock
         3. Verify disk space: df -h (need >1GB free)
         4. Check file permissions: ls -la raven_fp_lib/
         5. Re-run with timeout: timeout 300 icc2 -64bit -f floorplan.tcl
Prevent: Use -no_gui flag in batch: icc2 -64bit -no_gui -f floorplan.tcl
```

Lock files, interactive prompts, and insufficient disk space are typical causes of stalled batch runs in ICC2.

## 📝 Design Rationale

### Why Floorplan-Only Scope?

**Separation of Concerns**

Floorplan quality strongly influences timing closure, congestion behavior, and power distribution. By isolating floorplanning in a dedicated task, the design team can:
- Explore multiple floorplan variants independently
- Defer detailed placement/routing decisions
- Establish clean geometric baseline for all downstream flows

**Design Reusability**

A well-constructed floorplan serves as:
- Foundation for multiple place-and-route attempts with different strategies
- Template for ECOs and incremental improvements
- Reference for physical design documentation and sign-off

**Learning Efficiency**

Focusing exclusively on geometry, IO rings, and blockages exposes core ICC2 concepts without the distraction of:
- Complex placement algorithms and convergence
- Clock tree synthesis and skew optimization
- Full routing with congestion management
- Power delivery network analysis

This scope is ideal for design engineers new to physical design who want to master fundamentals before tackling integrated flows.

**Resource Efficiency**

A floorplan-only flow:
- Executes in seconds (vs. hours for full P&R)
- Minimizes compute resource requirements
- Enables rapid iteration on die dimensions and IO strategy
- Reduces licensing overhead for tools and PDKs

### Memory Organization in raven

raven integrates **RAM128 and RAM256** structures as **synthesized logic** rather than as hard macro blocks. This design choice:

**Advantages:**
- Simplifies floorplanning (no macro placement logic needed)
- Allows placement algorithm full freedom for distributed memory logic
- Enables optimization for congestion hotspots
- Supports better utilization of available core area

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly increased area vs. custom memory macros
- Reduced timing predictability (standard cells have longer delays)
- Higher power consumption compared to optimized memory compilers
- Less flexibility for ECO modifications to memory interfaces

**When to Use Distributed Logic vs. Macros:**
- Use macros: Large, high-density memory requirements (>100KB)
- Use distributed logic: Small memories (<16KB), high iteration rate, or area flexibility

### IO Ring in 180 nm Technology Context

In 180 nm SoCs, the IO ring operates at a higher voltage domain (typically 3.3 V) while the core logic runs at a lower voltage (typically 1.8 V or lower).

**Key Planning Considerations:**

- **Power Supply Separation:** IO ring needs independent power delivery (VDD_IO, VSS) isolated from core supply
- **Level Shifters:** Boundary between 3.3 V and 1.8 V domains requires level conversion cells to protect core transistors
- **ESD Protection:** IO pads require ESD clamp circuits (diodes, discharge paths) that need specific placement near pads
- **Ground Return:** Continuous ground plane with strategic vias from IO ring to core ground ensures low inductance

**Reserved Band Allocation:**

The 100 µm IO bands in this design accommodate:
- 40-50 µm: Pad cell itself (typically 70 µm × 70 µm pad frame in 180 nm)
- 30-40 µm: ESD clamp circuits and small decoupling capacitors
- 20-30 µm: Power and ground redistribution, level shifters
- Remaining: Routing corridors and margin for future optimizations

**Why 200 µm Core Margin?**

The 200 µm inset from die edge to core provides:
- Sufficient clearance for pad frame and peripheral structures
- Room for power rings and ground straps
- Buffer for foundry edge exclusion and manufacturing tolerance
- Space for future addition of analog blocks or special circuits

## 🎯 Floorplanning Best Practices

Even though this project stops at the floorplan stage, the following industry best practices are implicitly supported by the chosen constraints and recommendations for extending the flow:

### Aspect Ratio Optimization

**Principle:** Keep aspect ratio near 1:1 when possible to balance horizontal and vertical routing resources.

**For raven:**
- Current aspect ratio: 5.188 / 3.588 ≈ 1.44:1
- This is acceptable for a rectangular die; slightly wider dies are common in standard cells
- Wider horizontal aspect favors horizontal metal layers (M1, M3, M5 in 180 nm)

**Action Items:**
- If congestion appears along vertical edges, consider widening die horizontally
- If aspect ratio exceeds 2:1, evaluate core orientation and macro placement strategy

### Whitespace and Channel Planning

**Principle:** Leave sufficient whitespace and clear routing corridors to prevent congestion near IO and power structures.

**Recommendations:**
- Maintain 150-200 µm channels between IO bands and core boundary for power ring + routing
- Avoid placing high-connectivity cells (large multiplexers, decoders) near IO regions
- Reserve horizontal and vertical routing corridors for global signals

**Implementation:**
```tcl
# Add internal routing tracks
create_routing_guide -name routing_corridor_h \
  -boundary {{200 2500} {3388 2600}} \
  -layer M3
```

### Power Domain Partitioning

**Principle:** Plan partitions and domains early so the floorplan remains scalable to full SoC flows.

**Domains in raven:**
- Core domain: 1.8 V logic
- IO domain: 3.3 V IO, pads, ESD clamps
- Analog domain: Optional PLL, voltage reference (if present)

**Floorplan Implications:**
- Reserve separate supply pins and bonding pads for each domain
- Isolate supply and ground routing to minimize cross-coupling
- Plan level shifter placement at domain boundaries

### Clock Domain Planning

**Principle:** Identify clock domains and plan clock tree distribution early.

**For raven:**
- Main system clock (likely RISC-V SoC master clock)
- Optional IO clock domain (if async interfaces present)
- Test/scan clock (if DFT implemented)

**Floorplan Actions:**
- Identify clock source location (usually central core region)
- Plan primary clock buffer placement
- Reserve metal routing for clock tree distribution
- Avoid placing IO blockages in critical clock paths
